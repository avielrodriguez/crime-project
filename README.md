# When crime, climate, and socio-economic data come together (MySQL, Python, dbForge)

Learned a ton with this project, specifically in three areas:

1. Build a storage-efficient data warehouse
2. Construct four data pipelines using pandas library in Python
3. Perform data cleaning for 46K+ records using dynamic SQL query logic

To get an idea for the coding environment I was working with, here are some screenshots of my progress:
